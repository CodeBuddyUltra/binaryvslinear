# BinaryVsLinear
*__Aim__* <br><br>
Finding out who is faster among binary and linear search method<br><br>
*__Materials Required__*<br><br>
A large randomly generated array containing number<br><br>
*__Observation__*<br><br>
__For elements inside the list__<br>
```
Enter the number to be searched: 983
Element has been found
Time taken in binary search= 0.0
Number found
Time taken in linear search= 0.03061676025390625
```

__For element outside the list__<br>
```
Enter the number to be searched: 1051
Element has not been entered
Time taken in binary search= 0.0
Number not found
Time taken in linear search= 0.048163652420043945
```

*__Conclusion__*<br><br>
Binary search method is more faster and efficient than linear search
